Strings:

Algorithmic complexity of each respective function:
(annotated using big O notation)

	Function_Name(): big O runtime

	createSet(): O(n) //must initialize the flag array to have all slots EMPTY

	destroySet(): O(n) //for loop to delete each string with data

	numElements(): O(1)

	addElement(): O(n) //because it searches to see if element is unique

	removeElement(): O(n) //because it searches to see if element is unique

	findElement(): O(n) 

	getElements(): O(n) 

	search(): O(n) //linear probing
