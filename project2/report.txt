Unsorted:

Algorithmic complexity of each respective function:
(annotated using big O notation)

	Function_Name(): big O runtime

	createSet(): O(1)

	destroySet(): O(n) //for loop to delete each of n strings, n=count

	numElements(): O(1)

	addElement(): O(n) //because it searches to see if element is unique

	removeElement(): O(n) //because it searches to see if element is unique

	findElement(): O(n) 

	getElements(): O(n) //because of memcopy

	search(): O(n) //sequential/ linear search


Sorted:

Algorithmic complexity of each respective function:
(annotated using big O notation)

	Function_Name() : big O runtime

	destroySet(): O(n) //for loop to delete each of n strings, n=count

	numElements(): O(1)

	addElement(): O(n)// because of shifting associated with addition of element

	removeElement(): O(n) //because of shifting associated with removal of element
	
	findElement(): O(log(n)) //because of search function usage

	getElements: O(n) //because of memcpy

	search(): O(log(n)) //because of binary search
